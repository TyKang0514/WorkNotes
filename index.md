Thanks for coming to see my work.

Over the past seven years, I have spent most of my career in Internal Audit. During this time, I witnessed how a large amount of information—what we call data—is constantly generated in day-to-day business. At a certain point, I became inspired by the idea that making the most of this data can be a decisive factor for success, and that it can be applied across every part of the business.

I am currently a graduate student majoring in Business Analytics. I created this page to document my work history, track the development of my skills, and share it with others.
