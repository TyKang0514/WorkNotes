Thanks for coming!

This is a series of works where I put data analytics skills I’ve learned into practice. 

I spent most of my career in Internal Audit, where I had the chance to work with various types of data coming from different parts of the organization. Over time, I came to realize that how we utilize data is a decisive factor for business success, and it’s not just limited to one area, but extends across all business operations.

I am currently a graduate student majoring in Business Analytics. I created this page to track the development of my skills, which I hope will contribute to the success of either my future employer or maybe even my own business :)
